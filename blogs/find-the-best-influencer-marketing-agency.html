According to businessinsider, influencer-generated content on Instagram enjoys an average engagement rate of 5.7 percent or higher, compared to branded content's 2-3 percent. Therefore, using influencer marketing is a no-brainer. But where do you even start? Some businesses use an Excel sheet and the Instagram search bar to begin their search for Instagram influencers.

If you have a limited budget, hiring an influencer marketing company that makes use of pricey influencers might not be the best choice for you. Instead, go with that has a network of local micro-influencers. Otherwise, you can choose one who’s having the top names in their umbrella.
            Moreover, look at what the clients have to say about them and the source should not just be their website where they only have positive reviews, look for other platforms to be sure if they are the best ones for you to consider.
