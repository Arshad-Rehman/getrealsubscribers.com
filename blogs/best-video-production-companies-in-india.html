          width: 1140px;">
          <p>Nowadays, video content has taken over almost every niche market, whether it's fashion, fitness, or high-tech. Today, visuals play an extremely crucial role in captivating the audience’s attention, especially in the social media domain. For instance, we are more drawn towards Komal Pandey’s different style reels than the still shots she posts of her outfits.</p>
          <p>That's the impact of video in our lives, where visual content has taken over the majority of areas, including entertainment, news, shopping, and so on. And the reason this is happening is because people tend to remember things distinctly based on what they see rather than what they read.</p>
          <p>That’s why we still recognise the advertisements we used to watch in our childhood. For instance, the Nirma song - most of us must distinctly remember the visuals and audio from that advertisement. That is the power of video production!</p>
          <p>As per the data provided by Statista, in just the first quarter of 2023, online video content recorded a 92% user reach across the world. Moreover, the global video advertising market is expected to reach $326.20 billion in 2023, with a contribution of about $6.05 billion from India.</p>
          <h2>Why Is Video Production for You?</h2>
